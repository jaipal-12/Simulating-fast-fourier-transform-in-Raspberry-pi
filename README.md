 Designed and implemented a real-time signal analyzer on Raspberry Pi for frequency-domain signal analysis using
 FFT.
 ∗Converted time-domain signals into frequency-domain representation using FFT (O(N log N)).
 ∗Developed interactive visualization in Python (NumPy, Matplotlib) with dynamic controls for frequency,
 amplitude, and noise.
 ∗Implemented normalization and scaling techniques for accurate amplitude representation of FFT outputs.
 ∗Applied DSP concepts such as noise analysis, frequency resolution, and Fourier decomposition.
 ∗Tools: Raspberry Pi, Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
